# Frontend Mentor - Social media dashboard with theme switcher

![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I used bootstrap 5 and encountered a problem with the switch component they had. Since they started using svg for some of their components I couldn't easily fill their SVG and had to make my own, but the switch is really simple to replicate with html and css and I didn't want to create a 25x25 svg just so I could add the inner part of the switch.

I ended up creating one from scratch and designed it exactly like the one in the design.

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
